# First Launch Process

## Initial Scan Area Setup

When you first launch the program, you will see a welcome message:

Welcome to the EVE_Check program.
Do you want to load settings from a file? (y/n):

### Important First Launch Points:

- ‚ö†Ô∏è **On first launch**, the scan area settings file is not yet configured.
- üîß **Select "n"** (no) to begin scanning area setup.

### Scan Area Setup Process:

1. **After selecting "n", the program will prompt you to configure the scan area:**

Please move your mouse to the upper left corner of the area and press F12.
Then move your mouse to the lower right corner of the area and press F12 again.

2. **Setup steps:**

- **Step 1:** Move your mouse cursor to the **upper left corner** of the local chat area in the EVE Online client
- **Press F12** to set the first point
- **Step 2:** Move your mouse cursor to the **lower right corner** of the local chat area
- **Press F12 again** to complete the setup

3. **Automatic saving:**
- Region settings are automatically saved to the `Config_Region.json` file
- The program will use the saved settings for subsequent launches

### For subsequent launches:

- ‚úÖ **If settings have already been saved** - select "y" to load from file
- üîÑ **If you need to reconfigure the local chat area** - select "n" to reconfigure

üìå **Recommendation:** The scan area should cover the EVE Online local chat window where the Enemy ships. Ensure the area includes all possible target spawn locations.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note Regarding Security and Compliance

EVE Check is an **external application** (overlay) that runs alongside the EVE Online client, but **does not modify or interact with it directly**.

### Key Points:
* **No Client Interference**: The application does not inject code, read or modify game memory (RAM), or intercept network traffic.
* **OCR-Based**: Data analysis is performed solely by reading text from your computer screen (Optical Character Recognition - OCR technology). This is the same as if you were reading the information yourself.
* **EULA and TOS Compliance**: This method of operation does not violate the [End User License Agreement (EULA)](https://www.eveonline.com/en/agreement/eula) and [Terms of Service (TOS)](https://www.eveonline.com/en/agreement/tos) of EVE Online.

**Conclusion:** Using EVE Check **will not result in an account ban** by EVE Online security systems (e.g., Easy Anti-Cheat - EAC), as these systems are designed to detect programs that directly interact with the game. EVE Check is not such a program.
