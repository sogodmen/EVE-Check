## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note Regarding Security and Compliance

EVE Check is an **external application** (overlay) that runs alongside the EVE Online client, but **does not modify or interact with it directly**.

### Key Points:
* **No Client Interference**: The application does not inject code, read or modify game memory (RAM), or intercept network traffic.
* **OCR-Based**: Data analysis is performed solely by reading text from your computer screen (Optical Character Recognition - OCR technology). This is the same as if you were reading the information yourself.
* **EULA and TOS Compliance**: This method of operation does not violate the [End User License Agreement (EULA)](https://www.eveonline.com/en/agreement/eula) and [Terms of Service (TOS)](https://www.eveonline.com/en/agreement/tos) of EVE Online.

**Conclusion:** Using EVE Check **will not result in an account ban** by EVE Online security systems (e.g., Easy Anti-Cheat - EAC), as these systems are designed to detect programs that directly interact with the game. EVE Check is not such a program.
